## Internships
As a Criminal Justice major, you can choose from numerous internship opportunities in the five county areas. We have an extensive list of sites from which to choose or you can suggest a site of special interest to you. Most sites are accepted if they give you the opportunity to come in contact with the criminal justice system or have an anti-violence component. You will do a certain number of hours of work per week at your site. It is an intensive experience of hands on education.
