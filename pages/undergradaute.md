## A Hands-On Approach
![Brian and Nick Research]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized BrianNick_ICCWS2017.jpg){:.img-right}
Majoring in criminal justice helps to prepare students for careers as practitioners, researchers, and academics in a variety of public and private sector professions in both adult and juvenile systems of justice, at the federal, state, and local levels of government. It also provides the core liberal arts foundations for students interested in alternative career paths or advanced education in law school and graduate programs in criminal justice, criminology, and related social-science fields. Students have a wide variety of internship opportunities and our classes emphasize experiential learning. Our internationally recognized “Inside Out” program offers the opportunity to attend classes in a prison.

The mission of the Bachelor of Arts program in Criminal Justice is to foster a comprehensive understanding of the nature of crime and the effectiveness and fairness of society’s efforts to prevent and control it. Students engage in a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of crime, offenders, and victims, as well as the agencies, goals, laws, policies, and processes of the criminal justice system. Emphasis is upon promoting critical thinking about the kinds of questions and problems that shape developments in research, practice, policy and reform, and the skills utilized by scholars and professionals in the field.

## Highly Qualified Faculty

## Minor In Criminal Justice

## Criminal Justice Honors Program
The Department has its own Honors Program in which majors who are also University Honors students may tailor their honors experience to include a criminal justice specialization. In addition to the honors-level elective courses offered, an invaluable part of the program is the opportunity for students to develop an honors thesis based upon an undergraduate research project individually mentored by a criminal justice professor.

## Criminal Justice 4+1 BA/MA
High-achieving undergraduates will be invited by the faculty of the Criminal Justice Department to apply for the BA/MA 5 year program. Students admitted to this program begin taking graduate courses along with their undergraduate curriculum in their last three undergraduate semesters. They then complete the remaining requirements of a MA in Criminal Justice in the subsequent year. Eligible students will receive notification at the end of their Sophomore year, and applications will be accepted until October 7th of their Junior year.
