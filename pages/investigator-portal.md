## New Investigator Information
TUBRIC is a shared resource at Temple University.  We welcome both experienced users as well as investigators seeking to add a brain imaging component to their work. TUBRIC is also open to collaboration with users from external organizations, including other academic institutions and companies in the area.

### New Investigator Information
To get started with our center, a new user should follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Look over our [Facilities page](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/temple-university-brain-research-imaging-center/facilities/). This will help you determine what work can be carried out in the center.<br>

**Step 2:** Read over the [New Study Registration Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_gLaajRqqASTsAJhCACD_f6Xg0Ez_zix/view?usp=sharing) and submit the [New Study Request Form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18bpuhZB1QD6xWEwCWMmb_y8MBE2axO5K/view?usp=sharing). Users from outside of Temple University may also need to complete a Facility User Agreement.<br>

Completing Step 2 will provide us with valuable information about your proposed research, anticipated protocols, staffing needs, and current or requested funding sources.<br>

**Step 3:	Safety and Training**<br>
As needed, TUBRIC will provide training services for you and your team. Details regarding training are provided in our [Safety Training document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x4Gt40Nebl2Z_yr0mNIEctpT331Kea8K/view?usp=sharing).<br>

**Step 4:**	Contact our Center Coordinator, [Melissa Wilson](mailto:tubric@temple.edu) or the Center Director, [Jason Chein](mailto:jason.chein@temple.edu) for any additional information.
