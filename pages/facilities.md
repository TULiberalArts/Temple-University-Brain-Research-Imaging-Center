## TUBRIC Facilities and Funding
Major project funding was provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF), in the form of a “Major Research Instrumentation” award of approximately $2.4 Million. Additional support from the Temple University Provost’s office, the Office of the Vice President for Research (by way of the PA-CURE program), and the College of Liberal Arts enabled the acquisition of the state-of-the-art 3-Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma scanner, and to give it a home within a newly renovated center that provides the space and equipment needed to support research use of the scanner.
