Temple’s Department of Criminal Justice consists of an eclectic body of scholars committed to deepening our understanding of crime, governance and social justice. We emphasize inter-disciplinary and multi-method inquiries that make a difference to policy and practice. We pursue cutting-edge research and innovation that draws from and extends many strands of social science, including criminology and criminal justice, geography, history, experimental psychology, social psychology, social work, sociology, and social ecology. We explore critical issues in Philadelphia and across the United States in the context of global developments and concerns.

## Rehabilitation and Behavior Change

Rehabilitation and behavior change focuses on research involving high-risk offenders and criminal behaviors that include criminal and violent offending, recidivism, delinquency, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors.
 
Project Title: **Juvenile Justice-Translational Research on Interventions for Adolescents in the Legal System (JJ-TRIALS)**
Funding Agency: National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health
Affiliated Faculty: Steven Belenko (PI), Wayne Welsh, Jennifer Wood and Matthew Hiller
Description: A five-year multisite project to test implementation interventions to identify and reduce gaps in substance abuse services for adolescents under community juvenile justice supervision. The project involves a cluster randomized trial in 34 sites in 7 states. We are testing the impact of various interventions involving needs assessments, data-driven decision making, behavioral health training, and facilitated local change teams on organizational, staff, and youth outcomes.
 
Project Title: **SMART Supervision: CRIMNEEDS Evaluation**
Funding Agency: Bureau of Justice Assistance, US Department of Justice
Affiliated Faculty: Steven Belenko (PI) and Matthew Hiller
Description: The goal of this project is to enhance the efforts of the Philadelphia Adult Probation and Parole Department to address the unmet needs of moderate to high-risk offenders by fully implementing the Risk-Needs-Responsivity model. Moderate and high-risk officers are being trained in case management techniques and supervision planning, a customized criminogenic needs assessment tool is being developed, and a computerized decision-making tool is being developed to identify the best services in Philadelphia to address the criminogenic needs of probationers. Temple is conducting a randomized controlled trial to test the impact of these new tools on probationer outcomes and service engagement.
  
Project Title: **Philadelphia Revived: Obtaining Success through Peer Encouraged Recovery (PROSPER)**
Funding Agency: Laura and John Arnold Foundation
Affiliated Faculty: Steven Belenko
Description: The goal of the PROSPER project, a collaboration between Public Health Management Corporation (PHMC) and Temple University’s Department of Criminal Justice, is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of integrating Peer Recovery Specialists (PRSs) in an adult drug treatment court. A growing body of research demonstrates that peer support can facilitate recovery and reduces health care costs, but to date the model has not been tested in criminal justice settings. This study will be the first in the U.S. to assess whether PRSs, working with the Philadelphia Treatment Court (PTC) staff and treatment providers, can help to promote retention, engagement, and ongoing recovery post-graduation. During the first project phase, focus groups and interviews will be conducted with key informants to provide insight into how PRSs can best support PTC clients. During the second project phase, 112 newly enrolled PTC clients will be recruited and randomly assigned to either be connected with a PRS or to receive treatment-as-usual (56 per each condition), and monitored for 9 months. Key indicators such as relapse, re-arrest, and drug court completion will help determine whether clients assigned a PRS have greater program success than those in the control condition. This study will answer important questions regarding how to successfully integrate peer staff into drug courts, and provide preliminary indications of the efficacy of adding PRSs to the treatment court process.
 
Project Title: **Evaluability Assessment and Development of Outcome Evaluation for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections Violence Prevention Program (VPP)**
Affiliated Faculty: Wayne Welsh
Description: DVPP is a relatively new program being used to treat violent offenders who are eligible for parole. This specialized treatment program is designed to address cognitive distortions and aggressive behaviors in violent offenders to reduce the risk of future violence.
 
Project Title: **Research and Analyses of the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative (SVORI) Data Set**
Affiliated Faculty: Caterina Roman and Kate Auerhahn
Description: The data from the evaluation of the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative (SVORI) are very complex and rich panel data that allow for the investigation of the dynamics of re-entry and the post incarceration experience. Released in 2011, these data are already the focus of a great deal of secondary analysis and are likely to continue as such. Missing data are a problem endemic to panel studies, and to research on offenders, ex-offenders, and other socially marginal populations. Given the theoretical and practical currency of reentry issues in criminal justice, and the importance of panel data to the study of these issues, Auerhahn is examining the theoretical underpinnings and subsequent consequences of different approaches to the handling of missing data. Research using the SVORI data to investigate the relationship between family support and recidivism reveals that analyses utilizing listwise deletion and multiple imputation are substantively quite similar. More specific comparisons of similarities and differences between these results are discussed along with implications for the interpretation of findings.
Roman and colleagues are using the SVORI data to examine the relationship between prisoner debt, child support, employment and successful community reintegration. Recently published pieces include a descriptive analyses of child support debt and its relationship to service receipt post-incarceration (Criminal Justice Policy Review), and the longitudinal associations among child support debt, employment, and recidivism (Sociological Quarterly)

## Systems of Criminal Justice, Law, and Procedural Justice

Project Title: **Power, Knowledge and Evidence:  The Social Structure of the Production of Knowledge**
Affiliated Faculty: Kate Auerhahn
Description: Foucault’s genealogical method is combined with Donald Black’s framework of “pure sociology” to elucidate the relationship between social-structural inequality and the discursive environment of the courtroom. Rules governing the admissibility of evidence on grounds of relevance structure and limit the forms in which “truth” is constructed in court proceedings.    The analysis demonstrates that the formalized discourse of the courts – with specific focus on the rules of evidence – constitutes and reproduces dynamics of structural inequality.  Practices examined include the discourses surrounding admissibility and relevance, privilege exclusions, and the structure of ritualized courtroom operations and procedures such as arraignments, bail hearings, adjudication and sentencing.  The analysis reveals the ways in which evidentiary discourse reflects and ultimately reproduces social-structural relations of power and inequality with respect to various bases of stratification such as social integration, cultural legitimacy, and socioeconomic status.
 
Project Title: **Cannabis Decriminalization, Law Enforcement Activity in Philadelphia, and Impact on State Correctional Institutions**
Affiliated Faculty: E. Rely Vîlcică
Description: Vîlcică, in collaboration with researchers from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, will too use interrupted time series analyses to examine the impact of the marijuana decriminalization in Philadelphia on the state’s correctional institutions. For control purposes, the study will examine prison trends in: a) other drugs and non-drug related sentences; b) admissions and releases from prison pre- and post-intervention; and c) correctional institutions in the Philadelphia county and other comparable PA counties not undergoing similar interventions. Lastly, basic cost-savings analysis will also be conducted. The results should help inform current policy debate on marijuana decriminalization or legalization on a wider scale.
 
Project Title: **The Victim-Offender Overlap: Examining Police and Service System Networks of Response among Violent Conflicts**
Funding Agency: National Institute of Justice
Affiliated Faculty: Caterina Roman, Jerry Ratcliffe, Sharon Ostrow
Description:This project will examine how police and victim service system networks respond after violent street conflicts, and whether victims with offense/arrest histories are treated differently from victims who are not labeled as offenders.
  
Project **Title:The Parole Decision as a Critical Liberty Decision and Its Implications for Justice**
Affiliated Faculty: E. Rely Vîlcică
Description: In a series of inter-related research drawing on data from a recent comprehensive review of parole and correctional processes in Pennsylvania, Vîlcică examines the nature of parole decisionmaking and factors that explain variation in the decision to grant release. One line of inquiry, for example, focuses on testing for punitive themes in parole decisionmaking (Vîlcică, 2016, International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology) while another explores the role that visits to inmates who are serving their sentences have on parole decisions, a first attempt in the literature to link research on parole decision making with reentry research on prison visitation (Vîlcică, 2015, Journal of Criminal Justice). Both studies raise critical issues about the role of the parole decision in the overall justice process and concerns about fairness deriving from the discretionary nature of the decision. Future related work will examine variation in parole decisions due to decision maker and organizational attributes.
 
Project Title: **Bail, Pretrial Detention, and Case Dismissal: Punishment without Conviction?**
Affiliated Faculty: E. Rely Vîlcică
Description: Many defendants spend a significant amount of time in pretrial detention awaiting the adjudication of their cases only to have all charges against them dismissed. Considering that the main determinant of pretrial detention is the amount of cash bail assigned (i.e., many defendants cannot afford to post required bail), the pretrial detention of those defendants who do not get convicted of the crimes accused of raises serious questions of justice regarding the adjudication process. The goal of this study is to analyze the connection between the bail decision, the ensuing pretrial release/detention status, and the final case outcome. Using a sample of criminal defendants from Philadelphia, PA, predictive analyses will attempt to identify the factors predicting both the bail decision and the dismissal decision, and whether the pretrial detention/release status in itself plays a role in explaining case dismissal. Implications for policy will be addressed, particularly focusing on the use of pretrial detention as “punishment without conviction.”
 
Project Title: **Mortality’ in Criminal Cases in a Comparative View: The Production of Dismissals in Adversarial and Inquisitorial Justice Systems and Their Implications for Justice**
Affiliated Faculty: E. Rely Vîlcică
Description: Case attrition in criminal justice processing is a phenomenon that occurs in all criminal justice systems, regardless of their underlying legal foundations, yet no research has attempted to explain its variation from a comparative perspective. This study will fill in this gap. The analyses will draw on comparable available aggregate data and will emphasize the implications of case mortality for the achievement of shared justice goals in the two types of legal systems.
 
Project Title: **The Penology of Justice for Minors in the United States and Europe: Dedicated System or Mainstream Justice?**
Affiliated Faculty: E. Rely Vîlcică
Description: In contrast to the United States, many European countries do not have separate, specialized courts dedicated to the processing of delinquent youth. However, reform efforts there, especially in the most recent EU country members, are considering experimenting with such courts. In efforts to contribute to such discussions, this research will critically compare the merits of adopting a dedicated juvenile court system in Romania (a recent EU member) versus maintaining processing in the mainstream courts, drawing on lessons from the relatively long history of the American juvenile court.
 
Project Title: **Official Contact, Official Actions, Procedural Justice, and System Legitimacy**
Affiliated Faculty: E. Rely Vîlcică and Jeff Ward
Description: In September 2008, then-Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell imposed a moratorium on all parole releases from the state’s correctional institutions, following several killings of police officers by parolees recently released from prison. The moratorium was lifted in stages, with the parole process being fully restored in Spring 2009. The moratorium had several wide-ranging unintended consequences for the parole and corrections systems in the state. In recent investigations, Vîlcică documents the impact of the moratorium on parole practices, correctional processes, inmates, and correctional staff, and ultimately on the legitimacy of the two agencies affected, the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole and the Department of Corrections (Vîlcică, 2016, European Journal on Criminal Policy & Research, and Corrections: Policy, Practice and Research). Ongoing investigations, in collaboration with the researchers from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections and University of Maryland, use the moratorium as a case study in procedural justice in corrections, with a focus on both inmate behavior (e.g., amplification of misconduct) and inmate perceptions of the moratorium’s impact on incarcerated individuals (collected through qualitative data during the moratorium period). This corrections-based research should add substantively to the current body of knowledge on procedural justice and system legitimacy, which so far has emphasized earlier contact between citizens and the justice system.
Official contact with the criminal justice system can have deleterious, unintended consequences as suggested by labeling theory.  Research on the sanction-crime relationship has drawn increased attention to factors or conditions which affect the consequences of contact with the formal criminal justice system.  Recent collaborative work with Dr. Megan Augustyn has illustrated that high perceptions of procedural justice can prevent deviance amplification among a sample of serious juvenile offenders (Augustyn & Ward, 2015, Journal of Criminal Justice).  Increased attention to procedural justice is important because, unlike some moderating factors that have received attention in the literature like prior delinquency, sex, and race/ethnicity, treatment of offenders is within the purview of criminal justice system actors.
  
Project Title: **Criminal justice reform and labor markets in the 21st century**
Affiliated Faculty: Kate Auerhahn
Description: Over the last three decades, the US prison population grew dramatically, largely fueled by the enforcement of policies associated with the War on Drugs.  At the same time, the American economic system underwent radical transformation, characterized by growth in highly-skilled sector occupations and decline in unskilled jobs as a result of automation and foreign outsourcing, as well as declines in labor demand generally, as evidenced by three years of a “slack” labor market.  Current trends in criminal justice, such as increased interest in reentry and in reducing rates of return for former prisoners, as well as the growing movement toward drug policy reform, if continued, will ultimately result in the decarceration and reintroduction of large numbers of men and women into the labor market, the vast majority of whom are qualified for (at best) unskilled occupations.  These individuals are largely superfluous to the current economic system; given the cultural and social primacy of remunerative employment, the integration of these men and women into modern American society presents a significant social policy challenge.  Because the American economy is unlikely to evolve in ways that will absorb these individuals, alternative approaches to addressing both the labor market discrepancy and the consequent implications for crime merit exploration.  This project focuses on the idea of citizenship rights, and the idea of Guaranteed Basic Income, modeling a comparison of the costs of such a policy as compared to those of incarceration over the life course.
 
## Intersection of Public Health, Crime and Justice

Project Title: **Juvenile Justice-Translational Research on Interventions for Adolescents in the Legal System (JJ-TRIALS)**
Funding Agency: National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health
Affiliated Faculty: Steven Belenko (PI), Wayne Welsh, Jennifer Wood, and Matthew Hiller
Description: This five-year multisite project tests implementation interventions to identify and reduce gaps in substance abuse services for adolescents under community juvenile justice supervision. The project involves a cluster randomized trial in 34 sites in 7 states. We are testing the impact of various interventions involving needs assessments, data-driven decision making, behavioral health training, and facilitated local change teams on organizational, staff, and youth outcomes.

Description: The goal of this project is to enhance the efforts of the Philadelphia Adult Probation and Parole Department to address the unmet needs of moderate to high-risk offenders by fully implementing the Risk-Needs-Responsivity model. Moderate and high-risk officers are being trained in case management techniques and supervision planning, a customized criminogenic needs assessment tool is being developed, and a computerized decision-making tool is being developed to identify the best services in Philadelphia to address the criminogenic needs of probationers.  Temple is conducting a randomized controlled trial to test the impact of these new tools on probationer outcomes and service engagement.
 
Project Title: **Philadelphia Revived: Obtaining Success through Peer Encouraged Recovery (PROSPER)**
Funding Agency: Laura and John Arnold Foundation
Affiliated Faculty: Steven Belenko
Description: The goal of the PROSPER project, a collaboration between Public Health Management Corporation (PHMC) and Temple University’s Department of Criminal Justice, is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of integrating Peer Recovery Specialists (PRSs) in an adult drug treatment court.  A growing body of research demonstrates that peer support can facilitate recovery and reduces health care costs, but to date the model has not been tested in criminal justice settings. This study will be the first in the U.S. to assess whether PRSs, working with the Philadelphia Treatment Court (PTC) staff and treatment providers, can help to promote retention, engagement, and ongoing recovery post-graduation.

During the second project phase, 112 newly enrolled PTC clients will be recruited and randomly assigned to either be connected with a PRS or to receive treatment-as-usual (56 per each condition), and monitored for 9 months. Key indicators such as relapse, re-arrest, and drug court completion will help determine whether clients assigned a PRS have greater program success than those in the control condition. This study will answer important questions regarding how to successfully integrate peer staff into drug courts, and provide preliminary indications of the efficacy of adding PRSs to the treatment court process.
 
Project Title: **CRIME-PA: Crime Model Evaluation for Physical Activity**
Funding Agency: National Heart, Blood and Lung Institute (NIH)
Affiliated Faculty: Caterina Roman and Ralph Taylor (subcontractors to UCSD)
Description: The study evaluates a trans-disciplinary conceptual model of the relation of crime and crime-related perceptions to physical activity and other cardiovascular disease-related outcomes across the life span. Research activities include development of reliable measures of crime-related constructs that will be applicable across the life span.

## Geography of Crime and Justice 

Project Title: **Crime in and around neighborhood parks: Bad parks, bad neighborhoods, or both?**
Affiliated Faculty: Elizabeth Groff and Ralph Taylor
Description: Neighborhood parks in urban areas are public spaces that provide a variety of recreational opportunities for residents in a natural environment.  At the same time, they can become staging areas for illegal and disorderly activities. Systematic social observations describing park characteristics, US Census data quantifying neighborhood social composition, community surveys capturing social cohesion, and official crime data are analyzed using multilevel models to examine:  1) whether activity generating features of parks explain differences in crime levels across parks; 2) whether differences in parks’ neighborhood context explain differences in crime levels across parks; and 3) the extent to which park characteristics as opposed to neighborhood context explain differences in crime levels across parks.  Our results are discussed in terms of their implications for theories of crime and place.
 
Project Title: **The Philadelphia Predictive Policing Experiment**
Affiliated Faculty: Jerry Ratcliffe and Ralph Taylor
Description: We used cutting-edge predictive policing software to plot locations of increased risk of violent and property crime. The Philadelphia Police Department then applied three different types of policing activity in these areas. Across five Philadelphia Police districts, officers were made aware of the predictive policing areas on roll-call. In five others, a dedicated police car patrolled the predictive grids. And in five other districts, an unmarked car patrolled the grids. The six remaining districts were used as control locations. The results of this NIJ-funded program are currently being analyzed.
 
Project Title: **Linking Theory to Practice: Testing Geospatial Predictive Policing**
Funding Agency: National Institute of Justice
Affiliated Faculty: Alese Wooditch
Description: This NIJ-funded study seeks to advance the knowledge and utility of predictive policing by examining the strategy’s key components and processes. In collaboration with the Denver Police Department (DPD), this project evaluates available data sources for predictive analytics, and assesses a variety of predictive policing software programs to compare accuracy, reliability, and ease of use. The effectiveness of the best performing predictive policing software program will be conducted using a randomized control trial and the implementation of the predictive policing process by the DPD will be examined.
 
Project Title: **Neighborhood Context and Spatiotemporal Patterns Of Crime**
Affiliated Faculty: Jeffrey T. Ward
Description: With evidence for spatiotemporal patterning of crime mounting, there is a growing need to understand how neighborhood context impacts repeat/near repeat crime as well as crime that is not connected in space and time.  This project has provided one of the first assessments of how social-structural and neighborhood design features similarly and differentially contribute to spatiotemporally related burglaries and spatiotemporally unrelated burglaries   (Nobles, Ward, & Tillyer, in press, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency).  Other crime types and additional sites beyond Jacksonville are now under study.
 
Project Title: **Spatiotemporal Metropolitan Crime Patterns**
Affiliated Faculty: Ralph B. Taylor and Elizabeth R. Groff
Description: This NIJ-funded study examined connections between jurisdiction-level demographic structure, land use, street networks and changing violent and property crime rates in the first decade of the 21st Century in the nine county Philadelphia Metropolitan region. Results suggest increasing spatial inequality in violent crime across the region, and impacts of large scale commercial sites on property crime rates. Implications emerge for cross-jurisdictional police cooperation.
 
Project Title: **Community Criminology Crossroads**
Affiliated Faculty: Ralph B. Taylor
Description: This review of almost 100 years of community patterns of crime and delinquency highlights four critical issues blocking further development in our understanding of the causes and consequences of crime and delinquency ecological patterns: temporal scaling, spatial scaling, ecological construct validation, and selection (NYU Press, 2015).
  
Project Title: **Bail Prediction: Exploring the Role of Neighborhood Context in Philadelphia**
Affiliated Faculty: E. Rely Vîlcică
Description: This study (2015, Criminal Justice & Behavior) examined neighborhood effects on defendant pretrial performance. Specifically, the study looked at whether there was neighborhood-level variation in defendants’ failure-to-appear for trial and pretrial criminal conduct and explored the impact on these outcomes of neighborhood structural conditions such as socioeconomic status, stability, and racial composition. Prior bail prediction research has relied only on individual-level attributes. This paper, therefore, for the first time provided a novel perspective in recognizing the role of community context in empirical prediction of bail outcomes. The findings have important implications for bail decisionmaking policy and are relevant for the validity of the contemporary theories that emphasize the community context of crime in shaping deviant behavior.

## Policing, Security and Crime Prevention

Project Title: **Smart Policing: Hypothesis testing**
Funding Agency: Bureau of Justice Assistance
Affiliated Faculty: Jerry Ratcliffe
Description: This BJA-funded project is designed to help Philadelphia Police commanders and crime analysts coordinate analysis and decision-making around numerous crime problems in the city. We are introducing a more scientific approach to the direction of crime analysis, and a more collaborative and community crime oriented response to the issues uncovered by the analysis.
 
Project Title:**Translating ‘Near Repeat’ Theory into a Geospatial Policing Strategy: A Randomized Experiment Testing a Theoretically-Informed Strategy for Preventing Residential Burglary**
Funding Agency: Subcontract to the Police Foundation (National Institute of Justice cooperative agreement)
Affiliated Faculty: Elizabeth Groff
Description: For almost a decade research has shown that once a burglary occurs on a street, the homes on that street and on nearby streets are at a much higher risk of burglary over the next one to two weeks. But this research finding has not yet been translated into actionable crime prevention strategies for police agencies and tested in the United States using a randomized controlled experiment. This project aims to correct this deficiency by using the knowledge surrounding near repeat burglary to develop a crime prevention strategy.
 
Broadly speaking, the research seeks to determine if knowledge about near repeat patterns of burglary can actually be used for crime prevention purposes. Within this framework, we are attempting to determine if raising awareness about crime issues and crime prevention techniques with the residents near burglary locations can reduce further burglary in the area. The targeted department strategy we are suggesting is a one-page information-rich document (in English and Spanish) that would indicate that an incident has occurred and crime prevention efforts that can be undertaken by residents. We will also include in that document links to further information that will be available on line. A key feature of this experiment is the ability to get this information to all households within the defined area within 24 hours of a particular burglary incident (using community policing or patrol officers, auxiliary officers, or formal departmental volunteers).
 
At the end of the experiment, we will evaluate whether homes within the treatment areas were victimized less than those in the control areas. A random sample of residents will be surveyed to discover whether they received information and what actions they took in response. If a crime reduction occurs, a cost analysis will be conducted to discover whether the money saved through prevention offset the additional funds spent on notification.
  
Project Title: **CAREER: Applying a Criminological Framework to Understand Adaptive Adversarial Decision-Making Processes in Critical Infrastructure Cyberattacks**
Funding Agency: National Science Foundation
Affiliated Faculty: Aunshul Rege
Description: This project investigates the adaptive and evolving adversarial decision-making (ADM) process in critical infrastructure cyberattacks. Specifically, this project has five research objectives: (1) Investigate adversary-defender interaction and identify adversarial attack paths, (2) Understand adversarial adaptability when attack paths are disrupted, (3) Investigate the importance and characteristics of the various stages in attack paths, (4) Identify which factors impact ADM at each stage of the attack path, and (5) Improve the transparency, consistency and validation of adversarial attack paths.
  
Project Title: **CPS: Synergy: Collaborative Research: Towards Secure Networked Cyber-Physical Systems: A Theoretic Framework with Bounded Rationality**
Funding Agency: National Science Foundation
Affiliated Faculty: Aunshul Rege
Description: This project will develop a multidisciplinary framework that weaves together principles from cybersecurity, control theory, networking and criminology. The framework will include novel security mechanisms for networked cyber-physical systems (NCPSs) founded on solid control-theoretic and related notions, analytical tools that allow incorporation of bounded human rationality in NCPS security, and experiments with real-world attack scenarios. A newly built cross-institutional NCPS simulator will be used to evaluate the proposed mechanisms in realistic environments. This research transcends specific cyber-physical systems domains and provides the necessary tools to building secure and trustworthy NCPSs. The broader impacts include a new infrastructure for NCPS research and education, training of students, new courses, and outreach events focused on under-represented student groups.
 
Project Title: **Police legitimacy perceptions**
Affiliated Faculty: Ralph B. Taylor
Description: Much has yet to be understood about the determinants of perceived police legitimacy and related topics such as confidence in the criminal justice system. Recent research examines variable connections between perceived fairness and effectiveness depending both on perceiver race and urban vs. suburban location (Taylor, Wyant, Lockwood, Social Science Research, 2014 online), and impacts of both perceived fairness and incivilities on police confidence across the commonwealth (Taylor and Lawton Police Quarterly 2012)

## Youth Crime, Delinquency Prevention and Juvenile Justice

Project Title: **Reducing Gang Violence: A Randomized Trial of Functional Family Therapy (with the University of Maryland)**
Funding Agency: National Institute of Justice
Affiliated Faculty: Jamie Fader and Phil Harris
Description: The research will produce knowledge about how to prevent at-risk youth from joining gangs and reduce delinquency among active gang members. It will evaluate a modification of Functional Family Therapy (FFT), a model program from the Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development initiative.  This modification, FFT-G, was developed in an earlier phase of the research. A randomized trial testing this adaptation is currently underway with funding from Smith Richardson Foundation. The long-term goal is the designation of FFT-G as a national Blueprint Model Program for a new and especially high-risk population, members of street gangs, thus providing the first known evidence-based program (EBP) for such youth. In addition to scholarly articles and presentations about the project, this research will produce a program model that is ready for broad dissemination, an existing dissemination mechanism, and a model for how public agencies can fund EBPs using existing funding streams. Given recent estimates that more than 782,000 gang members reside in the U.S., this product is expected to have a large impact on community uptake of the model.
 
Approximately 200 adjudicated males age 11-17 who reside in inner city Philadelphia neighborhoods with high gang prevalence and are gang members or at high risk for joining a gang will be court-ordered to receive family therapy. These subjects are then randomly assigned to receive FFT-G (treatment) or another family therapy typically used by the court (control). Treatment lasts 5 to 6 months. Participating youths and their care-givers complete interviews prior to random assignment and at 6 months post-randomization, and data from court and public assistance records are obtained. Interviews assess criminal activity, involvement in gangs, and several targeted risk factors that contribute to these poor outcomes.  A process evaluation documents program implementation as well as costs for both the FFT-G and control groups.
 
Project Title:**Gangs, Social Networks and Geography: Understanding the Factors Associated with Gang Desistance**
Funding Agency: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention
Affiliated Faculty: Caterina Roman
Description: This two-site study, involving collaboration between Temple University and RAND, examines the factors that influence gang disengagement and crime desistance. The research team used social network methods to collect detailed data on 225 gang youth and their social relations in the Philadelphia and the District of Columbia.
 
Project Title: **The Penology of Justice for Minors in the United States and Europe: Dedicated System or Mainstream Justice?**
Affiliated Faculty: E. Rely Vîlcică
Description: In contrast to the United States, many European countries do not have separate, specialized courts dedicated to the processing of delinquent youth. However, reform efforts there, especially in the most recent EU country members, are considering experimenting with such courts. In efforts to contribute to such discussions, this research will critically compare the merits of adopting a dedicated juvenile court system in Romania (a recent EU member)  versus maintaining processing in the mainstream courts, drawing on lessons from the relatively long history of the American juvenile court.

## Criminal Behavior and Community Crime Rates

Project Title: **State of the art in agent-based modeling of urban crime: Overview, critical questions and next steps**
Affiliated Faculty: Elizabeth Groff
Description: Agent-based modelling is a relatively new methodology that facilitates theory-testing and thought experiments when empirical testing is not an option. This typically arises when data are not available or when manipulation of the variables of interest is not ethical or too expensive. This paper conducts a systematic review of the use of agent-based modeling to model urban crime published prior to 2015. Three goals motivate the endeavor -- summarize the state of the art, identify areas where we have strong evidence and ascertain gaps that are limiting our ability to create and evaluate models of urban crime. A set of forward-looking suggestions are proposed
 
Project Title: **Criminal Violence: Patterns, Explanations and Interventions (4th ed.)(Oxford University Press, 2016)**
Affiliated Faculty: Wayne Welsh , co-authored with Marc Riedel
Description: Describes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of violence that cuts across research and theories at the individual, group, organizational, community, and societal levels.
 
Project Title: **Making Ends Meet in Frankford, Philadelphia**
Affiliated Faculty: Jamie Fader
Description: This community-based study uses participant observation and in-depth interviews with men aged 25-34 living in the Frankford section of the city. This neighborhood was selected because of its high crime rates, racial/ethnic diversity, concentration of halfway houses and drug treatment clinics, and disproportionate number of returning prisoners. The main part of the study focuses on whether and how crime plays a role in how men in this community make ends meet – that is, whether and how they have desisted from criminal activity. Extant theory suggests that men of this age should exhibit stability in terms of employment, housing, and social ties. However, the characteristics of the neighborhood would suggest that legitimate opportunities may be scarce and their lives may be characterized by less stability and less desistance from offending than traditional life course theory would predict for men of this age. Close attention is paid to how they construct masculinity in a social context in which mainstream markers of manhood are difficult to attain. A secondary study in this community involves regularly attending community meetings and documenting the way in which residents frame the problem of crime and its solutions.
 
Project Title: **Philadelphia Drug Sellers Study**
Affiliated Faculty: Jamie Fader
Description: This research projects comprises an active offender study of drug sellers in Philadelphia. Interviews were conducted 2009-2012 and are being used to explore (1) how family criminal capital (i.e., criminal family networks) reduces the risks and potential costs of apprehension; (2) the relationship between legal and illegal employment, including drug sellers’ perceptions of whether drug dealing can be a long-term career; and (3) whether specific criminal justice sanctions (e.g., arrest, drug crackdowns) lead to adjustments in the strategies and techniques used to avoid apprehension.

## Policy Analysis and Program Evaluation

Project Title: **Criminal Justice Policy and Planning: Planned Change**
Affiliated Faculty: Wayne Welsh and Phil Harris (retired)
Description: This book, now in its 5th edition, by Wayne Welsh and Philip Harris (Routledge/Anderson, 2016), presents a comprehensive and structured account of the process of administering planned change in the criminal justice system. A simple yet sophisticated seven-stage model offers a full account of program and policy development from beginning to end.
 
Project Title: **SMART Supervision: CRIMNEEDS Evaluation**
Funding Agency: Bureau of Justice Assistance, US Department of Justice
Affiliated Faculty: Steven Belenko (PI) and Matthew Hiller
Description: The goal of this project is to enhance the efforts of the Philadelphia Adult Probation and Parole Department to address the unmet needs of moderate to high-risk offenders by fully implementing the Risk-Needs-Responsivity model. Moderate and high-risk officers are being trained in case management techniques and supervision planning, a customized criminogenic needs assessment tool is being developed, and a computerized decision-making tool is being developed to identify the best services in Philadelphia to address the criminogenic needs of probationers.  Temple is conducting a randomized controlled trial to test the impact of these new tools on probationer outcomes and service engagement.
 
Project Title: **Coming into Focus: What Philadelphia has Learned about Body Worn Cameras in Police Work**
Affiliated Faculty: Elizabeth Groff and Jennifer Wood
Description: This research evaluates a pilot deployment of body worn cameras in the Philadelphia Police Department. We conduct focus groups pre and post deployment, administer a survey to BWC officers to gain knowledge regarding their day-to-day experiences wearing cameras, and use a quasi-experimental design to determine whether the BWC officers’ behavior is different than other officers in the same district who did not wear cameras. We rely on official data sources to examine the effect of BWCs on officer behavior. We compare the activity of the 41 officers who volunteered to wear a camera with that of the 218 other officers in the 22nd district. We examine proactive officer actions as measured by arrests, car and pedestrian stops, and live stops. We also consider negative outcomes from police-citizen interactions such as use of force incidents and citizen complaints.
 
Project Title: **Reducing Gang Violence: A Randomized Trial of Functional Family Therapy (with the University of Maryland) – Funded by National Institute of Justice**

Description: The research will produce knowledge about how to prevent at-risk youth from joining gangs and reduce delinquency among active gang members. It will evaluate a modification of Functional Family Therapy (FFT), a model program from the Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development initiative.  This modification, FFT-G, was developed in an earlier phase of the research. A randomized trial testing this adaptation is currently underway with funding from Smith Richardson Foundation. The long-term goal is the designation of FFT-G as a national Blueprint Model Program for a new and especially high-risk population, members of street gangs, thus providing the first known evidence-based program (EBP) for such youth. In addition to scholarly articles and presentations about the project, this research will produce a program model that is ready for broad dissemination, an existing dissemination mechanism, and a model for how public agencies can fund EBPs using existing funding streams. Given recent estimates that more than 782,000 gang members reside in the U.S., this product is expected to have a large impact on community uptake of the model.
 
Approximately 200 adjudicated males age 11-17 who reside in inner city Philadelphia neighborhoods with high gang prevalence and are gang members or at high risk for joining a gang will be court-ordered to receive family therapy. These subjects are then randomly assigned to receive FFT-G (treatment) or another family therapy typically used by the court (control). Treatment lasts 5 to 6 months. Participating youths and their care-givers complete interviews prior to random assignment and at 6 months post-randomization, and data from court and public assistance records are obtained. Interviews assess criminal activity, involvement in gangs, and several targeted risk factors that contribute to these poor outcomes.  A process evaluation documents program implementation as well as costs for both the FFT-G and control groups.
  
Project Title: **Cannabis Decriminalization, Law Enforcement Activity in Philadelphia, and Impact on State Correctional Institutions**
Affiliated Faculty: E. Rely Vîlcică
Description: Vîlcică, in collaboration with researchers from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, will too use interrupted time series analyses to examine the impact of the marijuana decriminalization in Philadelphia on the state’s correctional institutions. For control purposes, the study will examine prison trends in: a) other drugs and non-drug related sentences; b) admissions and releases from prison pre- and post-intervention; and c) correctional institutions in the Philadelphia county and other comparable PA counties not undergoing similar interventions. Lastly, basic cost-savings analysis will also be conducted. The results should help inform current policy debate on marijuana decriminalization or legalization on a wider scale.

Project Title: **Measuring Success in Focused Deterrence through an Effective Researcher-Practitioner Partnership**
Affiliated Faculty: Caterina Roman
Description: This project supports the creation and maintenance of an effective, long term, sustainable research partnership that facilitates an overall research and evaluation approach utilizing joint strategy planning and development around implementing a focused deterrence law enforcement initiative in the city of Philadelphia. Focused deterrence strategies target specific criminal behavior committed by a small number of chronic offenders (in this case gang or group-affiliated offenders) who are vulnerable to sanctions and punishment.
 
Project Title: **Parole and Correctional Processes**
Affiliated Faculty: E. Rely Vîlcică
Description: In September 2008, then-Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell imposed a moratorium on all parole releases from the state’s correctional institutions, following several killings of police officers by parolees recently released from prison. The moratorium was lifted in stages, with the parole process being fully restored in Spring 2009. The moratorium had several wide-ranging unintended consequences for the parole and corrections systems in the state. In recent investigations, Vîlcică documents the impact of the moratorium on parole practices, correctional processes, inmates, and correctional staff (Vîlcică, 2016, European Journal on Criminal Policy & Research, and Corrections: Policy, Practice and Research).
 
Project Title: **Research Support and Evaluation for Philadelphia CeaseFire: Supporting and Developing a Public Health Approach to Gun Violence Reduction**
Affiliated Faculty: Caterina Roman
Description: Housed in Temple University’s Center for Bioethics, Urban Health, and Policy at the Temple School of Medicine, Philadelphia CeaseFire is a gun violence reduction intervention that utilizes the Cure Violence public health model of stopping the spread of disease. Philadelphia CeaseFire works by detecting and interrupting potentially violent conflicts; identifying and treating the highest risk; and, mobilizing the community to change norms. The evaluation consists of three main tasks: Creating a support system for staff in the collection of performance measures that will aid monthly and quarterly reporting; the conduct of an implementation evaluation; and the conduct of a rigorous impact evaluation.
The research also includes an evaluation of an expansion of the model to a local high school where two outreach workers have been employed to work directly with students.
 
Project Title: **Adult and Juvenile Drug Courts; DUI Courts**
Affiliated Faculty: Matthew Hiller
Description: Despite the rapid proliferation of drug courts since their origin in the late 1980's, research into the variation of this type of program have been hampered by the lack of a common measurement tool to quantify this. Dr. Hiller’s research in this area examines implementation and outcomes of both adult and juvenile drug court programs. One particular area of this research is focused on the development, testing, and psychometric properties of a self-report instrument designed to measure the 10 key components of the drug court model.
 
With regard to DUI courts, research in this areas involves an outcome evaluation that compared an intent-to-treat sample (i.e., all participants admitted to the program regardless of their graduation status) of multiple DUI offenders to a wait-list comparison group comprised of individuals who had applied to be in the DUI court, but were unable to participate because of limited program capacity. Findings showed that DUI court participation was significantly associated with better outcomes, thus adding to the limited literature on DUI court effectiveness.
 
Project Title: **Quantifying the short- and-long-term causes and consequences of adolescent gang involvement**
Affiliated Faculty: Jeffrey T. Ward
Description: Research on gangs has hit a coming of age.  However, there are still a number of important questions that necessitate clearer answers.  For instance, the gang-violence link provides strong evidence for an association.  Due to the inability to utilize experimental methods for obvious ethical reasons, less clear is whether gang involvement causes increased delinquency and other non-criminal outcomes such as precocious transitions or whether these relationships are spurious.  This project is seeking to better quantify the contemporaneous gang facilitation effect with longitudinal survey data by exploiting advanced statistical methods within a counterfactual framework.  Beyond the immediate impacts of gangs, the longer term consequences of gang involvement are also critical to understand.  Collaborative work has led to the identification of pathways that connect adolescent gang involvement with criminal and non-criminal outcomes in adulthood using structural equation models (Krohn, Ward, Thornberry, Lizotte, & Chu, 2011, Criminology).
 
Project Title: **Criminal Justice Reform and Labor Markets in the 21st Century**
Affiliated faculty: Kate Auerhahn
Description: Over the last three decades, the US prison population grew dramatically, largely fueled by the enforcement of policies associated with the War on Drugs.  At the same time, the American economic system underwent radical transformation, characterized by growth in highly-skilled sector occupations and decline in unskilled jobs as a result of automation and foreign outsourcing, as well as declines in labor demand generally, as evidenced by three years of a “slack” labor market.  Current trends in criminal justice, such as increased interest in reentry and in reducing rates of return for former prisoners, as well as the growing movement toward drug policy reform, if continued, will ultimately result in the decarceration and reintroduction of large numbers of men and women into the labor market, the vast majority of whom are qualified for (at best) unskilled occupations.  These individuals are largely superfluous to the current economic system; given the cultural and social primacy of remunerative employment, the integration of these men and women into modern American society presents a significant social policy challenge.  Because the American economy is unlikely to evolve in ways that will absorb these individuals, alternative approaches to addressing both the labor market discrepancy and the consequent implications for crime merit exploration.  This project focuses on the idea of citizenship rights, and the idea of Guaranteed Basic Income, modeling a comparison of the costs of such a policy as compared to those of incarceration over the life course.

## Center for Security and Crime Science

The Center for Security and Crime Science (housed in the Department of Criminal Justice at Temple University) is the first center in the United States devoted to Crime Science. In the 21st Century, thinking about crime has expanded in scope to move beyond domestic concerns and security has become more broadly construed as dealing with issues of public safety and social harm. Crime is now the business of private as well as public agencies, formal as well as informal entities, all seeking to address multiple levels of security concerns.

Crime Science is a departure from old ways of thinking about the problem of crime in society. Traditional criminology has concentrated on what happens after crimes are committed; that is, how we respond to a criminal act and how we define "crime". Crime Science aims to get upstream of crime and to proactively prevent it rather than merely respond to it. Crime Science examines those crimes which occur most frequently and then develops policy options which close off the criminal opportunities. This approach can work to reduce both the inclination and the opportunity to commit crime and harm communities.

Crime Science takes the issue of crime one step further than traditional criminology. It seeks contributions from inter-related disciplines, including; psychology, geography, public health, law and urban planning. The inter-disciplinary nature of Crime Science allows the development of a coherent strategy to influence both product and building design, and to examine the social and psychological factors, which contribute to criminal activity. The result is an integrated approach to the problem of crime.

## The Philadelphia Predictive Policing Experiment

The Philadelphia Predictive Policing Experiment is an ongoing collaboration between Temple University’s Center for Security and Crime Science (housed in the Department of Criminal Justice) and the Philadelphia Police Department. This [National Institute of Justice](http://www.nij.gov/Pages/welcome.aspx) funded research project has been the first place-based, randomized experiment to study the impact of different police strategies on violent and property crime in predicted criminal activity areas.

Predictive policing is an emerging tactic relying in part on software predicting the likely locations of criminal events. Predictive policing, while sometimes applied to offenders, is most frequently applied to high crime places. In this context, it involves ‘the use of historical data to create a spatiotemporal forecast of areas of criminality or crime hot spots that will be the basis for police resource allocation decisions with the expectation that having officers at the proposed place and time will deter or detect criminal activity’ [Ratcliffe, J. H. (2014). “What is the future… of predictive policing?” Translational Criminology, 2014 (Spring): 4-5 (definition on page 4)].

At present the law enforcement field lacks robust evidence to suggest the appropriate policing tactic in predicted areas. That is the subject of this timely study. The aim is to answer the question of whether different varieties of theoretically informed but also operationally realistic police responses to crime predictions estimated by a predictive policing software program can reduce crime.

The research team from Temple University and the Research and Analysis section of the Philadelphia Police Department randomly assigned 20 Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) districts into one of four experimental conditions. Five districts acted as controls, with a business-as-usual patrol strategy. In five districts, officers will be made aware of the predicted high crime activity area at roll call and asked to concentrate there when able (a simple awareness model). Five districts received the awareness model treatment as well as an additional patrol car solely dedicated to the predicted crime area. Finally, five districts received an intelligence-led, investigative response with an unmarked unit dedicated to the predicted area. The fieldwork ran from the spring of 2015 to the end of January 2016, and examined both property crime and violent crime. The predictive policing software employed was the [HunchLab](https://www.hunchlab.com/) program designed by [Azavea](http://www.azavea.com/).

At present, the data are being analyzed. More information and results, when available will be posted here.

Policing predicted crime areas: An operationally-realistic randomized, controlled field experiment.

## The Philadelphia Policing Tactics Experiment

A significant body of evidence exists that police are most effective at reducing crime when deployed to small, high crime areas known as hot spots. In the summer of 2010, the Philadelphia Police and researchers from Temple University’s Center for Security and Crime Science (housed in the Department of Criminal Justice), with support from the Bureau of Justice Assistance, set out to better understand the impact of different policing tactics deployed in hot spots. Three different tactics were tested problem oriented policing, offender focus policing and foot patrol.

The first step in the experiment was to identify the highest crime areas in Philadelphia using spatial analysis. We gave the Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) a map showing those hot spots and asked for their input in two important. One was in defining hot spot boundaries that were operationally sound and the other was in identifying which type of tactic they thought best suited the problems at that hot spot. For example, if there were a few people that were causing the problem then it made sense to apply offender-focused policing. If the problem was street robbery, then a problem-oriented policing approach to address the why that place was so amenable to street robbery would be appropriate. Regional Operations Commanders worked with District Captains to identify 27 areas suitable for foot patrol, 27 suitable for problem-solving, and 27 where police would focus enforcement on violent repeat offenders. The PPD returned a new map with 81 hot spots defined and the most appropriate tactic for each hot spot listed. We applied a random selection process so that 20 areas of each type were selected for additional police activity, and seven of each area type would receive the normal police response.

District officers in collaboration with members of the community and the support of personnel from police headquarters from the PPD2020 team conducted the problem-oriented policing tactic. Local initiatives to address the causes of violence varied across districts as problems were unique to each area.

Criminal intelligence officers and district personnel identified repeat violent offenders and they informed command staff at the district level. The role of focusing enforcement activities on the identified individuals generally fell to officers assigned to a unit out of the normal shift pattern in each district.

District Captains assigned foot patrol officers to each site and decided both the shift times and the operational tactics applied. Foot patrol officers usually (though not in one case) worked in pairs and were volunteers. The general pattern was two officers, for 8 hours a day, five days a week.

We employed repeated measures multilevel modeling using contrast coding to analyze the results because these types of models describe changes in an outcome measured at multiple time points for a given unit of analysis – ideal for this type of complex problem. We also controlled for trends over time and temperature (as violence is known to increase as it gets warmer).

We found that offender focus areas were successful in reducing all violent crimes by 42% compared to the equivalent control areas. These violent incidents included homicide, robbery, and assaults – both aggravated and misdemeanor. The offender focus sites were even more effective on violent felonies, reducing them by 50% compared to the equivalent control areas. Beyond the crime reduction, additional potential benefits of a targeted enforcement strategy are that it is less intrusive for law-abiding citizens because it avoids the wholesale increases in pedestrian and traffic stops that are so damaging to police community relations and that produce large numbers of arrests and flood the criminal justice system. Depending on implantation, the tactic may also increase the perception of the police as more procedurally just and improve community satisfaction with the police.

The foot patrol areas were not successful in reducing violence during the experimental period, nor were the problem-solving areas.

In sum, by focusing police efforts on the problem people associated with the problem places, police can achieve significant crime reductions while potentially avoiding negative community perceptions of their actions. However, we need additional research that more precisely measures what police officers do while in hot spots if we are to develop greater insight into why some crime reduction tactics are more successful than other ones.

## PROVE: Predictive Policing Software

[This project](https://www.hunchlab.com/tools/prove) has developed technology that will depict and predict current and future crime potential. In doing so, it operationalizes two grounded theoretical approaches to understanding localized spatial crime patterns. This combination of a long-term crime potential map surface with a short-term crime spike surface creates the opportunity for law enforcement and other criminal justice agencies to apply a theoretical understanding to the business of crime prediction. The resulting map of predicted crime will enable police departments to take a proactive approach to crime prevention, disruption and reduction, and will provide a foundation for predictive policing and crime prevention.

The project team of researchers from Temple University’s Center for Security and Crime Science (housed in the Department of Criminal Justice) and technical experts from [Azavea](http://www.azavea.com/) (a Philadelphia-based company that specializes in the creation of geographic web and mobile software, as well as geospatial analysis services to enhance decision-making) has created a custom software tool. This program will enable police departments and other agencies across the country to use their geocoded crime data in combination with freely-available census data and create micro-spatial estimates of future criminal activity at the local level.

As part of this ongoing project, one piece of research has been published already. We asked the question: Do fundamental demographic correlates of crime, proven important in community criminology, link to next year’s crime levels, even after controlling for this year’s crime levels? If they do, it would imply that shifting ecologies of crime apparent after a year are driven in part by dynamics emerging from structural differentials.

For Philadelphia (PA) census block groups, 2005 to 2009 data from the American Community Survey and 2009 crime counts were used to predict spatially smoothed 2010 crime counts in three different models: crime only, demographics only, and crime plus demographics. Models were tested for major personal (murder, rape-aggravated assault, and robbery) and property (burglary and motor vehicle theft) crimes.

We found that for all crime types investigated except rape and homicide, crime plus demographics resulted in the best combination of prediction/simplicity based on the Bayesian Information Criterion. Socioeconomic status (SES) and racial composition linked as expected theoretically to crime changes.

We concluded that intercommunity structural differences in power relationships, as reflected in SES and racial composition, link to later crime shifts at the same time that ongoing crime continuities link current and future crime levels. The main practical implication is that crime analysts tasked with long-term, one-year-look-ahead forecasting may benefit by considering demographic structure as well as current crime.

## The Philadelphia Foot Patrol Experiment

[https://youtu.be/0NUQsK0vnnM](https://youtu.be/0NUQsK0vnnM)

The Philadelphia Foot Patrol Experiment was a major research collaboration between the Philadelphia Police Department and researchers in the Department of Criminal Justice involving over 200 police officers on foot beats around some of the city’s most violent corners.

Since the 1980s, it had long been the opinion of many police and criminology researchers that police foot patrols improve community perception of the police and reduce fear of crime, but they don’t prevent actual crime. Results from the Philadelphia Foot Patrol Experiment suggested a more positive view of intelligence-led targeting of foot patrol officers to violent crime hot spots.

On the invitation of the Philadelphia Police Department, police and academic researchers worked together to plan the Philadelphia Foot Patrol Experiment as a randomized and controlled field experiment. With the resources to patrol 60 locations, researchers identified the highest violent crime corners in the city, using data from 2006 to 2008. Police commanders then designed 120 foot patrol areas around these corners, and stratified randomization was used to assign pairs of foot patrols with similar crime rates as either a control or a target area.

Officers patrolled in pairs with two pairs assigned to each foot patrol. They worked from Tuesday to Saturday in two shifts (10am to 6pm, 6pm to 2am) during the summer of 2009. After three months, relative to the comparison areas, violent crime decreased 23%. Official records of police activities during the intervention period reveal the following in the target areas: Drug‐related detections increased 15%, pedestrian stops increased 64%, vehicle stops increased 7%, and arrests increased 13%. Even with some crime displacement to nearby locations, analysis indicated that the foot patrols prevented 53 violent crimes during the summer. This project won the 2010 Excellence in Law Enforcement Research Award from the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Outstanding Experimental Field Trial Award from the American Society of Criminology’s Division of Experimental Criminology.

The [experiment results](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00240.x/abstract) were reported in the journal Criminology. The full citation is: Ratcliffe, J.

### Follow-Up Research And Further Findings From The Experiment
 
**Was there a long-term impact of foot patrol?**

Subsequent research by the team examined the long-term impacts of the Philadelphia Foot Patrol Experiment to determine what happened after the experiment was over. Results showed that beats that were in place beyond three months had diminishing effects during the experiment, an effect not seen with the shorter term beats. Foot patrol beats returned to their pre-experiment crime levels once the foot patrol experiment was concluded and the foot patrols were largely withdrawn. There was no evidence that the benefits from the Philadelphia Foot Patrol Experiment lasted beyond the time when the officers were assigned to the beats. These findings were published in an [article in Criminology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2012.00290.x/abstract).

**Did the presence of foot patrol change the way car patrols were used?**

The question of how foot patrol affected the car patrol officers in which the foot beats were embedded was also examined by the team. Official data describing the activities of foot and car patrol officers was analyzed. We found noticeable differences in the activities of the two types of patrol. Foot patrol was more likely to conduct pedestrian stops and deal with disorder and drug offenses while car patrol handled the vast majority of reported crime incidents and calls from the public. As a result, police managers and researchers should consider the impact of new strategies on the dominant patrol style. Co-production of community safety among officers assigned to different patrol styles is an under-researched area with potential for improving the success of crime reduction efforts through better internal coordination of police resources. These findings were published in an [article in Policing](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/13639511311302506): An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management.

**What was the experience of foot patrol officers?**

During the experiment we conducted field observations alongside the foot patrol officers. The observations were designed to capture officers’ perceptions of and experiences with the foot patrol function. Officers developed extensive local knowledge of their beat areas, and were what we call ‘reflective agents’ with varying styles and approaches to their foot patrol role. They had to negotiate the tension between what they perceived to be ‘real police work’ (arresting offenders) and the ‘reassurance’ function of foot patrol. They exerted spatial control of their beats through a repertoire of techniques which depended in part on officer style. We also learned that in some ways, the experimental nature of the intervention clashed with the common sense judgment of officers, including the need to adapt policing practices to changing criminal behavior. This research reinforces the need to integrate line officer knowledge in the design of place-based interventions. These findings can be found in an [article in Policing and Society](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10439463.2013.784292).

**Did the officers remain in their assigned beats?**

Not entirely. During focus groups conducted with foot patrol officers after the experiment, we gave officers maps of their beats and asked where they actually patrolled. In general, the areas they actually patrolled were about 0.13 square miles greater than the originally assigned patrol zones. Officers left their assignments for a number of reasons, including because they perceived that offenders had adapted to their patrol areas and moved to nearby locations, because they felt that areas just out side their beat should have been included in the area because specific locations caused community problems, and sometimes to add some variety when they became bored with patrolling the same area every day. More details of these findings can be found in our [article in the Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency](http://jrc.sagepub.com/content/51/3/377.abstract).

**What public health challenges did officers face on their beats?**

While the officers worked to establish rules and exercise some control over the areas they policed, they spent considerable time dealing with populations of people on the verges of society. On a daily basis, foot patrol officers assigned to small areas come face-to-face with not only traditional issues of crime, but also addition, mental illness, and homelessness. They struggled to see addicted drug users as vulnerable people at higher risks of morbidity and mortality; however, officers were more inclined to view people affected by mental illness as more vulnerable than threatening. They also had to deal with ‘microplaces of harm’ such as abandoned houses used for prostitution and drug use. In the end, officers, and foot patrol officers in particular, are ‘public health interventionists’. See our [article in Police Practice and Research](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15614263.2013.846982#abstract).

## The Crime Reduction Impact of CCTV in Philadelphia

In a 2006 referendum, about 80% of Philadelphia voters indicated a desire to change the city charterand to allow for CCTV cameras to be deployed within the city .That year a pilot project involving 10 pan,tilt and zoom cameras, and 8 static cameras was implemented. Researchers from Temple University’sCenter for Security and Crime Science found that after building in controls for long-term trends andseasonality, the introduction of the cameras was associated with a 13% reduction in overall crime,though the violence rate near the cameras was too low to identify a reliable violence reduction. Theevaluation suggested that while there appeared to be a general benefit to the cameras, there were asmany sites that showed no benefit of camera presence as there were locations with a positive outcomeon crime*.

Since then over 200 public CCTV cameras have been erected across Philadelphia since late 2007.Therewas clearly a need for a larger study.On the invitation of the Philadelphia Police Department, and with grant support from the NationalInstitute of Justice, we report here the preliminary results of a statistical evaluation of the impact ofthose cameras on various crime types. We say preliminary because we are still in the process ofcompleting a range of other analyses, which when combined with the work reported here, will allow usto better determine the overall impact of the cameras. This further work will include propensitymatching for control sites and a test for displacement to non-camera sites.

At present we can report preliminary results of a time series analysis of the impact of the CCTV camera violence, disorder, narcotics incidents, vehicle crime and burglary.Preliminary results of crime impact of CCTV cameras (pdf) (CCTVPreliminarytimeseriesanalysis.pdf).
