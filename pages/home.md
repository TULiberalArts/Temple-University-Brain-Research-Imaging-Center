  The Temple University Brain Research & Imaging Center (TUBRIC) is 
  a core research facility serving researchers from colleges and departments 
  across Temple University and the surrounding community. Modern brain imaging 
  approaches, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), 
  and Brain Stimulation, allow us to non-invasively explore the structure and function 
  of the brain. TUBRIC’s centerpiece, a Siemens PRISMA scanner, allows us to observe 
  precise variation in brain tissue, detail the “wiring” of the brain, and monitor the 
  changes in brain activity that coincide with specific mental abilities. Neuroimaging 
  observations like these allow researchers to test theories of healthy mental functioning, 
  and its breakdown.
