  TUBRIC is a core research facility that serves investigative teams from colleges
  and departments across Temple University and in the surrounding research community. 
  Modern brain imaging tools allow us to non-invasively explore the structure and function 
  of the brain, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) being the most widely used approach. 
  With MRI we can see precise variation in brain tissue, detail the “wiring” of the brain, 
  and observe the changes in brain activity that coincide with specific mental abilities. 
  The observations provided by MRI can serve as a testbed for our theories of healthy mental 
  functioning, and its breakdown. TUBRIC’s centerpiece, a Siemens PRISMA scanner, is the top-of-the-line 
  commercially available MRI scanner for use in human neuroimaging. MRI has become a mainstay of 
  behavioral and bio-behavioral science. Investigators on Temple’s main campus already have an 
  impressive track record of attracting funding for research that utilizes MRI-based methods
  and TUBRIC positions our researchers to launch cutting-edge research that pushes the boundaries 
  of understanding in our respective disciplines.
