The Temple University Brain Research & Imaging Center (TUBRIC) is a core research facility serving researchers from colleges and departments across Temple University and the surrounding community. Modern brain imaging approaches, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), and Brain Stimulation, allow us to non-invasively explore the structure and function of the brain. TUBRIC’s centerpiece, a Siemens PRISMA scanner, allows us to observe precise variation in brain tissue, detail the “wiring” of the brain, and monitor the changes in brain activity that coincide with specific mental abilities. Neuroimaging observations like these allow researchers to test theories of healthy mental functioning, and its breakdown.

Major project funding for the center was provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the form of a “Major Research Instrumentation” award of approximately $2.4 Million. Additional financial support was provided by the Temple University Provost’s office, the Office of the Vice President for Research, and the College of Liberal Arts.
